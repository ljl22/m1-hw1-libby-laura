I had several problems with merging the branches, but I was able to resolve the issues by the end of the homework assignment.

I also hit an (END) result when I ran a git status at one point that wouldn't allow me to make any additional changes to the git bash; I ended up closing all windows and starting again. I have an additional question about this, but will email in some screenshots.

No outside resources were used beyond what was provided through the recorded lectures.
